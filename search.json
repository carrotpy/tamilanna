    "text": "Finding roots for Higher-Degree Equations:\nHigher-degree equations can be polynomials or equations that contains radicals sometimes may have transcendental functions, i.e., Logarithmic and trigonometric functions.\nFor example lets us assume an equation of the form ax²+bx+c=0 for which the roots can be found using the formula\nHowever, if our equation contains higher degrees or transcendental functions, we can use numerical methods to find the roots.\nLet us take a look at the simple iteration method to solve the below quadratic equation.\nThe first step is to rearrange the variable on the left side. Thus the equation is reduced into\nx = \\frac{x_1}{x_2} * \\int a dx\nNow let us use python to find the roots.\nWe make an initial guess for x, assuming that 100 iterations are more than enough.\nBy substituting the value of x using the guess, we find the new value of x(x_new).\nIf the value of x_new is not equal to x, consider this value as the new value of x.\nThe algorithm repeats the step 2nd and 3rd until the x_new = x.\nx = 0 # Initial Guess\nfor iteration in range(1,101): # Setting iterations to 100 x_new = (4*x**2 + 6)/10 # Finding the new value if abs(x_new - x) &lt; 0.000001: # degree of accuracy condition break x = x_new # Assigns the value of x_new to x print(‘The root : %0.5f’ % x_new) print(‘The number of iterations : %d’ % iteration)The root : 1.00000 The number of iterations : 50\nBy using a different initial guess, the second root can be found.\nx = 1.5 # Initial Guess\nfor iteration in range(1,101):# Setting iterations to 100 x_new = (4*x**2 + 6)/10 # Finding the new value if abs(x_new - x) &lt; 0.000001: # degree of accuracy condition break x = x_new # Assigns the value of x_new to x print(‘The root : %0.5f’ % x_new) print(‘The number of iterations : %d’ % iteration)The root : 1.50000 The number of iterations : 1\nTo be continued ….."
